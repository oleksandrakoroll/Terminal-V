# Terminal V Festival 2025 Webpage

## Description

A webpage for the Terminal V Festival 2025, as part of my university assessment. The goal was to create a website with information about the festival, using HTML and Bootstrap. I also had to host it on GitHub Pages.

## Features

**Information about Terminal V Festival:** The website provides details about the Terminal V Festival, including the date, location, and lineup highlights.
**Bootstrap Styling:** I used Bootstrap to make the page look nicer and be responsive.
**Google Fonts:** I added Google Fonts to use custom fonts like Roboto or Oswald.
**Hover Effects:** I added some hover effects to the buttons and cards to make the page more interactive.
**Venue Map:** The website includes an embedded Google Maps showing the location of the Royal Highland Centre in Edinburgh.

## Challenges

**Getting the Image to Show Up:** I had some trouble getting the background image to display correctly, but I eventually figured out the file path issue.
**Making Visuality Good:** I'm not a designer, so making the page look visually appealing was a challenge. I tried to use the color palette provided and Bootstrap utilities to create a decent design.
**Responsiveness:** Making sure the page looks good on different screen sizes was difficult, and I'm not sure if it's perfect on all devices.

## Known Issues

* The alignment of the cards in the lineup section might be slightly off on some screen sizes.
* I couldn't work to make it responsive on every device
* I'm not 100% sure if the hover effects will be working perfectly every time.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* Bootstrap 5
* Google Fonts
* Git
* GitHub Pages

## Self-Assessment

I believe this webpage meets the core requirements of the assessment. I used Bootstrap for styling, incorporated the specified color palette, and hosted the page on GitHub Pages. However, I acknowledge that there are areas where the design or functionality could be improved.

## Future Improvements

* Improve the responsiveness of the page.
* Refine the design and styling.
* Add more content about the festival.
* Add photos to every artist in line up highlits section.
